# Preeclampsia
This is medical based project.
Pre-eclampsia is an abnormality Observed in 5% of pregnant women.
When diagnosed, it can turn out to be fatal.
The research began a few months ago.
The first process is collecting data.
The collection of 100+ real world samples is completed.
The main aim is to predict symptoms of pre-eclampsia before 4-5 months.
Basically, it's symptoms is noticed after 6 months.
BUt its too late to cure it by that time.
Hence, our aim to find resonable symptoms in first 3-4 months.
